Our website does not have a name, we simply called it “Mall”. Our team over the past few weeks has been working hard on this assignment. And we all complete this assignment in time before our deadline. Each one of us chooses the pages we wanted to do and finishes them. We help each other out to fix the bug and work as a team. We have a lot of meetings to organize and discuss our Mall. Our mall have 5 catagories which is sports, books, kitch supplies, games and bathroom items. And to let you know if you are on the right store. We have 2 store that separate categories. We have the SPORT and BOX store.
